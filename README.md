# ðŸ…ºðŸ…´ Keystroke Enumerator

Count effective keystrokes made to type files based on keyboard layouts.

To type the letter `a` one keystroke is required. Two keystrokes (SHIFT+A) are needed to type the
capital version `A`. The goal of the application is to count exactly how many times one pushes a
keyboard button. This allows comparison of different keyboard layouts.

The [keyboard layouts](core/src/main/resources/layouts) are defined in CSV files. Currently, the
following layouts are implemented:

* `de-CH`
* `de-DE`
* `en-US`
* `fr-CH`
* `fr-FR`

## Example

A German poem result in the following output:

```
$ ke Mondnacht.txt 

Scanned 1 files of 341 bytes in 0.039s
Found 41 unique in 323 symbols on 14 lines

Layout  Keystrokes      Redundancy[%]
DE_DE   365             13.003
FR_FR   368             13.932
DE_CH   380             17.647
FR_CH   389             20.433
EN_US   424             31.269

Layout DE_DE requires 59 keystrokes (16.164%) less than layout EN_US

```

* The text contains 323 symbols or characters. Of these 41 symbols are unique, meaning for example
  the letter `a` is used 13 times.

* The input text is a German poem requiring 365 _Keystrokes_ on a German _Layout_ and 380
  _Keystrokes_ on a German based _Layout_ such as the Swiss German `DE_CH`.

* On an english based _Layout_ 424 _Keystrokes_ are needed to get all the German letters like `Ã¤`.

* The _Redundancy_, measured in percent, describes the deviation of a theoretical perfect keyboard
  layout requiring only 323 keystrokes for a text of 323 symbols.

* Comparing the first and last layouts the German based layout is more efficient and requires 59
  keystrokes or 16.2% less than the English based layout.
