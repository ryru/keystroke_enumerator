# ðŸ…ºðŸ…´ Keystroke Enumerator

Multi-platform tool to count the number of keystrokes needed to write a file or multiple files in a
folder.

This CLI tools can be of value in situations such as:

* Is keyboard layout X more efficient than layout Y?
* In codie golf to count symbols and keystrokes
* Comparing programming languages syntax

## How it works

To type the letter `a` one keystroke is required. Two keystrokes (SHIFT+A) are needed to type the
capital version `A`. The goal of the application is to count exactly how many times one pushes a
keyboard button. This allows comparison of different keyboard layouts.

The [keyboard layouts](core/src/main/resources/layouts) are defined in CSV files. Currently, the
following layouts are implemented:

* `de-CH`
* `de-DE`
* `en-US`
* `fr-CH`
* `fr-FR`

Symbols that are not included in the file are counted as Unicode characters. E.g. the letter `Ã¤` can
be written as `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`u`, `e`, `4`, `Space` requiring 6 keystrokes.

## Example

A German poem result in the following output:

```
$ ke Mondnacht.txt 

Scanned 1 files of 341 bytes in 0.044s
Found 41 unique in 323 symbols on 14 lines

Layout  Keystrokes      Redundancy[%]
DE_DE   368             13.932
FR_FR   368             13.932
DE_CH   383             18.576
FR_CH   392             21.362
EN_US   427             32.198

Layout DE_DE requires 59 keystrokes (16.033%) less than layout EN_US

```

* The text contains 323 symbols or characters. Of these 41 symbols are unique, meaning for example
  the letter `a` is used 13 times.

* The input text is a German poem requiring 368 _Keystrokes_ on a German _Layout_ and 383
  _Keystrokes_ on a German based Swiss German `DE_CH` _Layout_.

* On an english based _Layout_ 427 _Keystrokes_ are needed to get all the German letters like `Ã¤`.
  These letters are assumed to be types as Unicode combinations.

* The _Redundancy_, measured in percent, describes the deviation of a theoretical perfect keyboard
  layout requiring only 323 keystrokes for a text of 323 symbols.

* Comparing the first and last layouts the German based layout is more efficient and requires 59
  keystrokes or 16% less than the English based layout.

## Build and run

Clone to local disk, build with gradle and run the command line tool with the project as input.
